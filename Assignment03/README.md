This repository contains the solution for Assignment 3: Python Programming Concepts, focusing on tasks like e-commerce data processing, iterators, generators, exception handling, and function decorators.

Contents
# Task 1: E-commerce Data Processing

Part A: Data Validation
A function to validate customer orders, ensuring that only orders with numeric and non-negative totals are considered valid. Exception handling is used to handle type conversion issues.

Part B: Discount Application
A function to apply a 10% discount to all valid orders where the total exceeds $300.

Part C: Total Sales Calculation
A function to calculate the total sales from the valid, discounted orders using the reduce() function.

# Task 2: Iterator and Generator

Part A: Custom Iterator
A custom iterator SquareIterator that yields the squares of the first n natural numbers.

Part B: Fibonacci Generator
A generator function fibonacci_generator() that yields the Fibonacci sequence up to a given number n.

# Task 3: Exception Handling and Function Decorator

Part A: Chained Exceptions
A function that divides a list of numbers by a divisor, raising custom exceptions for division by zero and non-numeric inputs.

Part B: Exception Logging Decorator
A decorator exception_logger that logs exceptions raised during the execution of a function, printing the exception type, message, and the function name.
