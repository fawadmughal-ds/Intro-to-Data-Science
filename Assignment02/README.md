# Smart Data Aggregator: Python Collection Handling Assignment

This project is a **Smart Data Aggregator** that uses Python's built-in data structures—**Lists**, **Tuples**, **Sets**, and **Dictionaries**—to manage and analyze user data efficiently. Each part of the project demonstrates how these data structures can be used to solve common problems related to data processing, analytics, and management.

## Overview
The **Smart Data Aggregator** processes various types of user data using Python collections. Each part of the assignment focuses on different aspects of data handling:

- **Part 1**: User data processing using **Lists**.
- **Part 2**: Immutable transaction management using **Tuples**.
- **Part 3**: Unique data management using **Sets**.
- **Part 4**: Feedback aggregation and manipulation using **Dictionaries**.

## Features
- Efficient filtering, sorting, and manipulation of data using Python collections.
- Handling large datasets while maintaining data integrity.
- Aggregation of feedback and user interactions across multiple modules.
- Support for operations on immutable data (using tuples), set operations, and dictionary comprehensions.

## Data Structures Used
- **List**: Used for managing and processing user information such as IDs, names, ages, and countries.
- **Tuple**: Employed for transaction data that must remain immutable, such as transaction IDs, amounts, and timestamps.
- **Set**: Used to manage unique user IDs who visited specific web pages and perform efficient set operations (e.g., union, intersection).
- **Dictionary**: Used for storing and manipulating user feedback, where user IDs are mapped to feedback details (ratings and comments).

## Installation
To use this project, clone the repository and run the Python scripts. No external libraries are required as the project relies solely on Python’s built-in data structures.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/fawadmughal-ds/Intro-to-Data-Science/
cd Assignment02
python filename.py
